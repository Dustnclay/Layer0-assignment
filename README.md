* What you intended to accomplish in this assessment
 I really strived to *understand* what was going on in the code and not just copy and paste from the docs/examples, and to really learn what was happening. Of course the overall goal given is to decrease load times, and this was a learning curve because I haven’t done this for a traditional site yet.

* What you’d do as next steps if you had more time
I would dig a little more into what it looks like to cache the css/javascript files for the above the fold in the PDP and possibly PLP and see how that effects the load-time and see if its significant. It seems like Images take the most time by far but I’m curious about the others.

* Any feedback you may have for Layer0 regarding the process.
I believe this assessment did exactly what is was designed to do, It was a mixture of quick learning, researching, and Implementing using your product. I really enjoyed the dive into using your product to optimize a site, It was a challenge, an introduction to the day to day of what the position would be, and I learned a lot.The pre-written code, examples, and the docs were phenomenal, essentially every question I had was answered with a little digging into the docs. Overall I thought this was a great exercise.
