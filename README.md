* What you intended to accomplish in this assessment
 I really strived to *understand* what was going on in the code and not just copy and paste from the docs/examples, and to really learn what was happening. Of course the overall goal given is to decrease load times, and this was a learning curve because I haven’t done this for a traditional site yet.

* What you’d do as next steps if you had more time
I would dig a little more into what it looks like to cache the css/javascript files for the above the fold in the PDP and possibly PLP and see how that effects the load-time and see if its significant. It seems like Images take the most time by far but I’m curious about the others.

* Any feedback you may have for Layer0 regarding the process.
I believe this assessment did exactly what is was designed to do, It was a mixture of quick learning, researching, and Implementing using your product. I really enjoyed the dive into using your product to optimize a site, It was a challenge, an introduction to the day to day of what the position would be, and I learned a lot.The pre-written code, examples, and the docs were phenomenal, essentially every question I had was answered with a little digging into the docs. Overall I thought this was a great exercise.

----------------------- Comparison of websites ---------------------------------------
The first thing I noticed is the time that was reduced after visiting the site the first time. On the original site the time remained around four seconds each run, with layer0 my initial load is 3 seconds and it remains less than 3 for the next two runs.

largest contentful paint forstep one dropped from 2.5 t 2.1 
-for step 2 it drops from 6.6 to 3.4

My time to first byte is on the original site has an error stating that it is unusually high but after implementing layer0 it's dropping from 1.7 down to .6
